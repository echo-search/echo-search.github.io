<h1>We’re Going Worldwide!</h1>

<p>EchoSearch is stepping into the global stage, one search at a time. Over the last three months, we’ve seen around 100 visitors find and use our site — a small start, but a meaningful one. Most of that traffic has come through Google itself, where people discovered EchoSearch among the search results and clicked through out of curiosity or trust. That’s growth in motion.</p>

<p>Our reach has stretched quietly but steadily, with clicks from users in the UK, the US, and India showing how awareness is beginning to spread. While these numbers are modest next to larger platforms, they mark genuine interest from real users across borders. Each impression and click tells a story of discovery — people searching for something better, faster, simpler.</p>

<p>The journey from a few local searches to worldwide recognition doesn’t happen overnight. But it’s happening. Seeing users click EchoSearch on Google proves that visibility is expanding naturally, powered by the same principle we started with: information should be easy to reach, not buried under distractions. Every visit is a signal that what we’re building matters somewhere, to someone.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at the recent data — the first table shows how often people saw and clicked EchoSearch on Google, while the second shows how many visitors actually used the site directly.</p>
