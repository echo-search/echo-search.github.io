<h1>We’re Going Worldwide!</h1>

<p>EchoSearch has started reaching users beyond its original circle. Over the past three months, we’ve welcomed around 100 visitors — small numbers in the grand scheme, but they mark the first ripple of global interest. Each visitor represents someone who chose clarity over clutter, and that matters more than scale right now.</p>

<p>Going worldwide isn’t just about expansion; it’s about visibility. We’ve been tracking how we perform next to giants like Google, comparing impressions and clicks across a few countries. The difference is, of course, enormous — Google dominates everywhere — but our early stats show that EchoSearch is being noticed, even in a world of endless search options.</p>

<p>We’re not chasing their numbers; we’re studying the patterns. Seeing where searches come from, what terms people use, and how engagement grows helps us shape the next phase. The mission stays the same: make information accessible without the noise. As we move ahead, each click is a sign that someone out there prefers simple, honest search.</p>

<p>Below are the latest comparisons between Google’s reach and ours across selected countries. The gap is wide, but the potential is real — and that’s exactly why we’re going worldwide.</p>
