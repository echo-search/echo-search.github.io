  <h1>EchoSearch — Terms of Conditions</h1>
  <p><small>Last updated: <time>2025-11-05</time></small></p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of EchoSearch, the search service and related websites and tools (collectively, the "Service") operated by EchoSearch ("we", "us", or "our"). By accessing or using the Service you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. The Service</h2>
    <p>EchoSearch provides search functionality, optional UI features, and links to third-party content. The Service is provided as-is and may include tools, widgets, suggestion lists, or integrations. The Service does not create user accounts; it does not require or maintain personal user accounts for basic search use.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Eligibility and Use</h2>
    <p>You may use the Service only in compliance with applicable law and these Terms. You agree not to use the Service for illegal activities or to upload, transmit, or distribute content that violates laws or third-party rights. Because the Service does not maintain user accounts, rules that presuppose account management (for example, password protection or account access controls) do not apply here.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Acceptable Conduct</h2>
    <p>When using EchoSearch you must not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service to unlawfully infringe intellectual property rights.</li>
      <li>Attempt to interfere with, overload, or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Upload or transmit content that is unlawful, defamatory, obscene, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
      <li>Misrepresent your relationship with any person or entity or impersonate another.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to block or refuse access to users or traffic that threaten the integrity of the Service, its availability, or its users' experience.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Content and Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The Service returns search results and may include links to third-party websites, services, or content. We do not endorse, guarantee, or control the content on third-party sites. Your interactions with third-party sites are solely between you and that third party. We are not responsible for third-party content, practices, or policies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All rights, title and interest in the Service (including the website design, text, graphics, and code) are owned or licensed by EchoSearch, unless otherwise noted. You may not copy, reproduce, or create derivative works of protected elements of the Service without written permission. You retain ownership of content you lawfully contribute, but by submitting content you grant EchoSearch a limited, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, display, and use that content to operate and promote the Service.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. DMCA and Copyright</h2>
    <p>EchoSearch respects intellectual property rights. If you believe content accessible via the Service infringes your copyright, you may submit a notice containing all information required by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) or other applicable law. Provide a clear description of the allegedly infringing material, contact information, and a statement under penalty of perjury that you are the rights holder or authorized to act on behalf of the rights holder.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Information we collect and how we use it is described in our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using the Service you agree to that Privacy Policy and its terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, EchoSearch disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or uninterrupted availability. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information returned by the Service.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, EchoSearch and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, or licensors will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages arising out of or related to your use of the Service, including loss of data, loss of profits, or business interruption. Our total aggregate liability for direct damages arising from or related to these Terms will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) in the 12 months prior to the event giving rise to the claim, or one hundred pounds sterling (£100) if you paid nothing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless EchoSearch and its affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of the Service; (b) your violation of these Terms; or (c) your violation of any rights of another party.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>12. Termination and Suspension</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time and for any reason, including for violation of these Terms or for operational reasons. Because the Service does not use accounts, "termination" may take the form of IP or device-level restrictions or other technical measures. Termination does not limit any other remedies we may have.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom (or England and Wales), without regard to conflict of law principles. Any dispute arising under or in connection with these Terms will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>15. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about these Terms, DMCA notices, or anything else related to EchoSearch, please contact us at the address provided on the website or in the Privacy Policy.</p>
