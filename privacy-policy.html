  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 20, 2025</p>
  <p>Welcome to EchoSearch. This Privacy Policy explains how EchoSearch collects, uses, stores, and safeguards information when you use our platform. We value your trust and are committed to being transparent about how we handle your data. Because privacy is not just a checkbox but a responsibility, this document goes into detail about our practices, your rights, and the principles that guide us.</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>EchoSearch is designed to provide a streamlined and accessible search experience without compromising your right to privacy. Unlike services that profit by building profiles around your activity, EchoSearch is built on the principle of minimizing the collection of personal information. This policy is intended to provide clarity so you can make informed choices while using EchoSearch.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>EchoSearch is built with a “privacy-first” philosophy. We only gather what is necessary to provide core functionality, improve performance, and maintain the service. We do not require personal accounts, email addresses, or identifiers to use our search engine. Information we may collect includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Search Queries:</strong> The words or phrases you type into the search bar may be logged temporarily to generate results. These queries are not tied to personal identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Basic system data such as browser type, device type, language preference, and approximate location (e.g., country or region) may be detected to display search results relevant to your area.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Metrics:</strong> Non-identifiable data such as how many times certain features are used, the frequency of visits, or which pages are most accessed may be collected to help improve functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> If a technical issue occurs, we may collect anonymous error reports to diagnose and resolve the problem.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Importantly, we do not collect names, emails, phone numbers, or precise GPS location.</p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>The limited information EchoSearch collects serves specific purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide accurate and relevant search results.</li>
    <li>To maintain service stability and detect errors.</li>
    <li>To analyze patterns and improve features in line with user needs.</li>
    <li>To defend against misuse, abuse, or attacks targeting EchoSearch.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not build user profiles, track you across the web, or sell your search history to advertisers. Your queries remain your own.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>EchoSearch strives to minimize data retention. Search queries are not linked to personal identities, and temporary logs may be kept only as long as necessary to operate the service effectively. Error logs may be retained for troubleshooting, but they are stripped of personal identifiers. We implement secure storage methods to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.</p>

  <h2>5. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>By default, EchoSearch avoids invasive tracking. We do not use third-party cookies or fingerprinting methods to follow your browsing across sites. However, we may use basic cookies for functional reasons, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Remembering your theme or display preferences.</li>
    <li>Maintaining session stability during a single use.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can disable cookies through your browser settings, though some features may not work as intended without them.</p>

  <h2>6. Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>EchoSearch does not sell, rent, or trade your information. We avoid sharing data except under the following limited circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If compelled by applicable law, regulation, or valid legal process, we may disclose minimal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Integrity:</strong> In rare cases, to prevent fraud, cyberattacks, or threats to the security of EchoSearch and its users.</li>
    <li><strong>Operational Needs:</strong> Aggregated and anonymized data may be used internally for analysis or shared publicly to communicate performance trends. This data cannot be linked to individuals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Your Choices and Control</h2>
  <p>We respect your right to privacy and give you meaningful choices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can use EchoSearch without providing personal details or registering accounts.</li>
    <li>You may clear cookies or disable them entirely if you prefer not to store preferences locally.</li>
    <li>You may adjust browser privacy settings or use private/incognito mode for an additional layer of privacy.</li>
    <li>You may avoid sharing error data by disabling diagnostics in your browser or operating system (where applicable).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
  <p>We take safeguarding your data seriously. EchoSearch uses encryption protocols, secure server infrastructure, and best practices in system design to minimize risk. While no system is completely immune to threats, we consistently review and update our practices to align with industry standards.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>EchoSearch is accessible to general audiences but is not designed for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe information about a child has been inadvertently collected, please contact us so we can delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>10. International Use</h2>
  <p>EchoSearch may be accessed globally. By using the service, you acknowledge that your data may be processed in the country where our servers are located, which may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. Regardless of location, we apply consistent standards to protect your privacy.</p>

  <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>EchoSearch may occasionally display links to third-party websites. Clicking those links will take you outside our platform. We are not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of those external sites. We encourage you to review their privacy statements before interacting with them.</p>

  <h2>12. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect improvements, changes in technology, or updates in legal obligations. The “Effective Date” at the top will indicate when changes take effect. Your continued use of EchoSearch after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>13. Transparency Commitment</h2>
  <p>We aim to keep this Privacy Policy clear and understandable, not buried in legal jargon. Our commitment is to ensure you always know how EchoSearch treats your data. If significant changes occur, we will make them visible and provide reasonable notice so you can make informed decisions.</p>

  <h2>14. Summary of Principles</h2>
  <p>To summarize the heart of EchoSearch’s privacy approach:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collect the minimum necessary information.</li>
    <li>Retain data only as long as needed for operation.</li>
    <li>Never sell or exploit your data for profit.</li>
    <li>Offer transparency and user choice wherever possible.</li>
    <li>Continually improve security and respect for your privacy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>15. Final Word</h2>
  <p>Your trust is essential. EchoSearch is built not just as a search engine, but as a statement that privacy and convenience can coexist. Every decision we make about collecting, storing, or discarding information is filtered through that lens. By using EchoSearch, you are part of a movement toward a web that is more respectful, open, and aligned with user rights.</p>
