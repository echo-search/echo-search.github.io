# EchoSearch Security Policy

## Supported Versions

EchoSearch recognizes the critical importance of security and advises users to remain aware of the versions they employ. Certain versions are actively supported, while others are no longer supported and may present increased exposure to vulnerabilities. Users are strongly encouraged to utilize versions that are current and compatible with their systems in order to reduce risk and ensure a safer operational environment. Older, unsupported versions may continue to function; however, they may contain weaknesses that have been identified in public disclosures or may be discovered in the future. Users should remain informed regarding version histories and update practices to maintain awareness of potential exposure.  

Supported versions are those for which vulnerabilities are actively monitored and addressed. Users of these versions benefit from a broader understanding of potential security challenges and are able to take informed steps to mitigate associated risks. Unsupported versions do not receive such attention, and reliance upon them introduces potential exposure to known and unknown issues. Awareness of these distinctions allows users to prioritize operational safety and exercise due diligence while utilizing EchoSearch.  

Users should consult release notes, version histories, and related documentation to ascertain the status of the version in use. Familiarity with the versioning scheme and historical context of updates ensures that users can make judicious decisions concerning usage and exposure. Understanding the distinction between supported and unsupported versions is fundamental to maintaining security awareness and responsible usage practices.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

EchoSearch is committed to preserving the integrity and security of its systems and values responsible disclosure from its user community. Any individual who discovers a potential security vulnerability within EchoSearch is strongly encouraged to report such findings in a structured and precise manner. The preferred and exclusive reporting channel for security vulnerabilities is the **GitHub Issues tab of the EchoSearch repository**. Users should submit a new issue with a title clearly indicating a security concern, such as `Security Vulnerability Report`.  

Reports submitted via the GitHub Issues tab are **monitored on a daily basis** to ensure timely acknowledgment and assessment. Users can therefore expect that submissions will be reviewed promptly, facilitating a rapid and organized response. This regular monitoring ensures that potential security issues are not overlooked and that the security process remains effective and responsive to community input.  

Reports must contain sufficient technical detail to permit verification and understanding of the vulnerability. At a minimum, submissions should include the version of EchoSearch in which the vulnerability was observed, a detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the issue, and an explanation of the potential impact on users or system integrity. Users are also encouraged to provide proof-of-concept examples, logs, or screenshots that substantiate the existence and nature of the vulnerability. Such documentation facilitates timely and accurate evaluation by the security team.  

It is imperative that the vulnerability not be disclosed publicly prior to assessment and resolution. Premature disclosure may place users at risk by making potential exploits publicly available. Responsible disclosure through the designated channel allows the security team to evaluate, verify, and implement appropriate measures in a controlled manner. Users are expected to maintain confidentiality regarding discovered vulnerabilities until formal guidance or mitigation steps are communicated.

## Vulnerability Assessment

Upon receipt of a vulnerability report via the GitHub Issues tab, EchoSearch conducts a comprehensive assessment to determine the nature, severity, and scope of the reported issue. The assessment process involves reproducing the vulnerability in a controlled environment to confirm its existence and to understand the specific conditions under which it may be exploited. Accurate reproduction of the issue is critical to ensure that responses are based upon verified evidence.  

Severity is evaluated based upon several criteria, including the potential for unauthorized access, compromise of sensitive information, disruption of functionality, and likelihood of exploitation. Critical vulnerabilities are those that could result in substantial impact, including but not limited to complete loss of control, unauthorized access to user data, or large-scale system compromise. High-severity vulnerabilities may present localized or conditional risk, whereas medium-severity vulnerabilities typically require specific conditions to exploit. Low-severity vulnerabilities have minimal impact and generally do not threaten system integrity or user data.  

The scope of the vulnerability is also analyzed to identify which versions, configurations, or components are affected. This ensures that users and the development team can accurately understand potential exposure and prioritize attention accordingly. Thorough assessment of scope and severity allows for an organized response and informed decision-making with respect to mitigation strategies.

## Response to Vulnerabilities

Once a vulnerability has been assessed and verified, EchoSearch follows a structured response protocol. Verification requires reproducing the vulnerability under controlled conditions to ensure that subsequent actions are based upon demonstrable evidence. Following verification, the scope of the vulnerability is reviewed in detail to identify affected versions, configurations, or functional components. This understanding enables users and stakeholders to comprehend the potential impact on their installations and to take informed precautions.  

Mitigation strategies are then considered, which may include recommendations for configuration changes, temporary workarounds, or procedural adjustments designed to minimize risk. Users are formally informed regarding recommended actions to address reported vulnerabilities. Throughout the response process, communication is conducted in a professional and deliberate manner. Users submitting reports via the GitHub Issues tab will receive acknowledgment of receipt, periodic updates regarding the status of evaluation, and guidance on any interim precautions that may be warranted. Transparency and precision in communication are essential to maintaining user trust and ensuring the security process is effective.

## Best Practices for Users

Although EchoSearch endeavors to provide a secure and reliable environment, the responsibility for security is shared with users. Users are encouraged to remain vigilant regarding the version they utilize, to monitor developments within the repository, and to adhere to best practices for safe operation. Familiarity with release notes, advisories, and known issues enhances the user’s capacity to make informed decisions regarding the use of EchoSearch.  

Users should exercise caution when employing features that interact with external systems or third-party resources. Awareness of potential risks, combined with adherence to recommended usage practices, supports the overall integrity of the user experience. Users are also encouraged to report observed anomalies or suspected vulnerabilities exclusively via the GitHub Issues tab, maintaining confidentiality until resolution. Daily monitoring of the Issues tab ensures that all submitted reports are addressed in a timely manner.  

By adhering to these principles, users contribute to the secure and responsible use of EchoSearch. Vigilance, awareness, and proper reporting practices collectively enhance the safety of the system for the entire user community. Users who engage with EchoSearch in a deliberate and informed manner help ensure that potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed efficiently.

This policy establishes formal guidance regarding supported versions, structured reporting through the GitHub Issues tab (monitored daily), assessment of vulnerabilities, response procedures, and recommended user practices. Adherence to these principles ensures that EchoSearch can be utilized safely, responsibly, and with due attention to security considerations.
