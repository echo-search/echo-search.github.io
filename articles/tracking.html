  <h1>Tracking, Analytics, and Privacy</h1>
  <p>
    A clear explanation of how EchoSearch uses StatCounter,
    what it measures, and what it deliberately does not.

  <section>
    <h2>Why This Page Exists</h2>

    <p>
      Some users have raised a fair concern:
      EchoSearch promises “no trackers”, yet statistics are shown.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page explains exactly how that works, using plain language and
      no fine print.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What People Usually Mean by “Trackers”</h2>

    <p>
      When people talk about trackers, they usually mean systems that:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Follow you across different websites</li>
      <li>Build personal or advertising profiles</li>
      <li>Record searches tied to an individual</li>
      <li>Link behaviour to ads or ad networks</li>
      <li>Sell or share user data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      EchoSearch does not do any of the above.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why StatCounter Is Used</h2>

    <p>
      EchoSearch uses <strong>StatCounter</strong> for one reason:
      to understand whether the site is functioning and being used.
    </p>

    <p>
      StatCounter provides basic traffic statistics that help answer questions
      like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Are people visiting the site?</li>
      <li>How many pages are loading?</li>
      <li>Is usage increasing or decreasing?</li>
      <li>Are new users discovering EchoSearch?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These are operational questions, not questions about who you are.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What StatCounter Measures</h2>

    <p>
      StatCounter measures simple, aggregated activity such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Page views</strong> – a page was loaded</li>
      <li><strong>Sessions</strong> – a visit occurred</li>
      <li><strong>Visitors</strong> – an approximate count of unique users</li>
      <li><strong>New visitors</strong> – first-time visits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data is used to see overall trends.
      It is not used to analyse individual behaviour.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What StatCounter Does NOT Do on EchoSearch</h2>

    <p>
      On EchoSearch, StatCounter is not used to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identify you personally</li>
      <li>Track you across other websites</li>
      <li>Record your searches</li>
      <li>Create advertising or behavioural profiles</li>
      <li>Fingerprint your device</li>
      <li>Sell or share your data</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There is no way to use this data to identify a specific person.
      That information is never collected.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why This Still Respects Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      Privacy does not mean collecting no numbers at all.
      It means refusing to monitor people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Knowing that “a visit happened” is very different from knowing
      who visited, what they searched for, or what else they do online.
    </p>

    <p>
      EchoSearch only allows the first kind of information to exist.
      The second kind is intentionally avoided.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Promise Still Stands</h2>

    <p>
      EchoSearch exists so people can search the web without being watched.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using StatCounter in this limited, privacy-respecting way
      does not change that promise.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are no ads, no profiling, and no hidden tracking.
      If that ever changes, it will be stated clearly.
