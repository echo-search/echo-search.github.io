  <h1>An Update on Our Open Source Journey</h1>
  <div class="date">Published Dec 24, 2025</div>

  <p>
    Transparency has always been a core principle of this project. From its early days, we made the deliberate decision to release the code as open source, allowing anyone to inspect it, learn from it, and contribute to its development. That choice shaped not only how the project evolved technically, but also how it was perceived and used.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, we want to clearly communicate an important change. After one full year of being open source, the project will transition away from an open-source model.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight">
    <strong>Effective June 3rd, 2026, this project will no longer be open source.</strong>
  </div>

  <p>
    This article explains why this change is happening, what it means for users and contributors, and how we are approaching the transition.
  </p>

  <h2>The Purpose of Going Open Source</h2>

  <p>
    When the project was first released, it was still in an experimental and fast-moving stage. Open sourcing the code allowed for rapid feedback, external scrutiny, and organic improvement. Developers could explore how features worked internally, suggest optimizations, and identify issues early.
  </p>

  <p>
    Open source also played an educational role. By making the code publicly accessible, we enabled others to study real-world implementations, architectural decisions, and trade-offs. That openness helped establish trust and credibility during the project’s earliest phase.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the course of the year, the project benefited from issue reports, discussions, forks, and community-driven experimentation. Even when changes were not merged directly, the insights gained were valuable.
  </p>

  <h2>How the Project Has Evolved</h2>

  <p>
    Over the past year, the scope and maturity of the project have increased significantly. What began as a relatively compact codebase has grown into a more complex system with deeper dependencies, tighter integrations, and higher expectations around reliability and performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    As usage increased, so did the need for stronger guarantees around security, consistency, and long-term maintainability. These needs require a different development approach than the one that works best for early-stage experimentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this stage, unrestricted public access to the full source code is no longer the most effective way to support the project’s direction or its users.
  </p>

  <h2>Why We Are Transitioning Away from Open Source</h2>

  <p>
    The decision to close the source code was not made lightly. Open source brings many benefits, but it also introduces challenges that become more pronounced as a project grows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maintaining an open repository requires additional overhead: managing external pull requests, handling forks that may misrepresent the project, responding to security disclosures in public, and ensuring that unfinished or internal-only work is not misunderstood or misused.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moving to a closed-source model allows development to focus more tightly on stability, performance, and cohesive design. It also enables us to protect original implementation details and reduce the risk of fragmentation or misuse.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Change Means in Practice</h2>

  <p>
    Until June 3rd, 2026, the project will remain open source under its current terms. During this time, the repository will continue to be accessible, and existing contributions will remain acknowledged.
  </p>

  <p>
    After that date, the public repository will no longer be updated, and the source code will no longer be publicly available. Future development will continue privately.
  </p>

  <p>
    This transition does not mean the end of the product or the service. Users will still be able to use the platform as intended. The change applies only to how the underlying source code is distributed.
  </p>

  <h2>Respecting the Community’s Role</h2>

  <p>
    Open source participation played a meaningful role in shaping the project during its first year. Every issue report, discussion, and suggestion contributed to its improvement, whether directly or indirectly.
  </p>

  <p>
    We recognize that some users strongly value open-source software and may be disappointed by this change. That perspective is valid, and we want to be clear and honest rather than ambiguous or reactive.
  </p>

  <p>
    The decision to transition away from open source is about ensuring long-term sustainability and quality, not about disregarding the value of openness.
  </p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

  <p>
    As the project moves forward, our priorities are clarity, reliability, and responsible growth. A closed-source model gives us the flexibility to iterate faster internally while maintaining a stable experience for users.
  </p>

  <p>
    We remain committed to transparency where it matters most: communicating changes, explaining decisions, and setting clear expectations. This article is part of that commitment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The open-source chapter of this project was an important one. It served its purpose, helped the project mature, and laid the groundwork for what comes next.
